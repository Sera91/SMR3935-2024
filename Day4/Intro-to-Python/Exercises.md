# Exercises

## Ex.1
Write a python script to perform the matmul between a squared matrix and its transpose and time it for the following matrix sizes: 500^2,1000^2,2000^2

## Ex.2
Write a python script containing a cupy kernel that performs vector addition between vectors of integers. Test and time the operation for different vector size (500,1000,5000,10000,100000). Compare the time taken to do this operation with Numpy.

## Ex.3
Write a Python script that use the Cupy matmul function to perform the matrix multiplication of 2D arrays and compare the execution time with Numpy


## Report of the results
Write the results obtained on the comparison of different operations performed with Numpy and Cupy in a Markdown file.
